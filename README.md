## 🚀 About Me

I am a Senior Backend Engineer specialized in Django-based architectures and distributed systems.

For over two decades, I have designed, built, and led high-availability platforms with strong emphasis on scalability, reliability, and infrastructure automation.

My core strength is backend architecture — especially Django systems operating at scale.

## 🏗 Backend Architecture

Backend is my primary expertise and architectural foundation.

- Advanced Django applications
- Django REST Framework (favorite, but I know many others)
- Complex domain modeling
- Multi-service architecture
- High-throughput APIs (10k+ req/min systems)
- Celery distributed task orchestration
- Queue-based processing (Redis, SQS, AMQ)
- Performance optimization
- Middleware design considerations
- Scalable authentication & enterprise integrations

I focus on clean architecture, maintainable systems, and long-term scalability.

## ⚙️ Distributed Systems & Infrastructure

- Microservices architecture
- Kubernetes (EKS)
- Docker-based deployments
- Autoscaling strategies
- Infrastructure as Code
- CI/CD pipelines (GitLab)
- Observability & monitoring strategies
- Cost allocation & infrastructure optimization

I design systems that are resilient, fault-tolerant, and production-ready.

## ☁️ Cloud & Data Engineering

- AWS (EKS, S3, RDS, SNS, SQS, AMQ)
- Data pipelines
- Pandas-based data processing
- Real-time ingestion systems
- Queue-driven workflows
- Distributed processing strategies

---

## 📊 Architecture Principles

When building systems, I prioritize:

- Scalability
- Observability
- Cost efficiency
- Reliability engineering
- Domain clarity
- Infrastructure automation
- Production-grade robustness

## 🤖 AI & LLM (Currently Expanding Expertise)

I am actively evolving in AI-driven backend systems, focusing on:

- LLM integrations in production
- RAG architectures
- LangChain-based orchestration
- AI-powered internal tools
- Data Science Ops (DSOps / LLMOps fundamentals)
- AWS SageMaker experimentation

While AI is a growing focus, my foundation remains strong backend and distributed systems engineering.
